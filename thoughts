PROJECT:
GNL (GET NEXT LINE)
This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

First Thoughts:
I have to read the first line of the file called by it's own File Descriptor.
Static Variables will be often used.
If a loop of any kind is called my function should read the entire file, one line at a time.
It should work to read both from a file, than from the standard input.
Auxiliar functions must be in the get_next_line_utils.c
If it has nothing to read, or if any error occurs, then it should return NULL.
Every time the end of the line is reached, then it should return the current line.
Every line must have the \n character, except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.

Good Concepts to learn:
Static Variables. (DONE)
Buffer Size. (DONE)
Malloc and Free (NOT DONE YET)


First Steps:
Learn about System Calls (DONE)
Learn about file descriptors (DONE)

Starting to Assemble Things:
What if i use a file as like a "temporary storage" just to store the lines read from the original file descriptor?
A line ends at the \n character. What if i read through the line until i reach the \n character? But how?
